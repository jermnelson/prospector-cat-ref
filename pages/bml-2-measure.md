title: Iteration 2 - Measuring
published: 2017-10-05

## Search Engine Indexing
With the release of the second iteration of the GoldRush BIBCAT project, 
measuring the impact publishing the linked data has difficult
because of problems with getting Google or Microsoft to fully index
all of the BIBFRAME Instances and later Items into the search index.

## Speed of Workflow
We are also optimizing the speed of the workflow as a key metric as 
in anticipation of the next BML Build where we move to 500,000-1,000,000k
source MARC XML records.

## Google Analytics
To provide a different view of the web traffic of the BIBFRAME Instances 
and Items, we added Google Analytics tracking code to each of these views.
