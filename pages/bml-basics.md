title: Build-Measure-Learn Project Basics
published: 2017-10-05

As part of the [Lean Startup](http://becomingaleanlibrary.com/) (and the topic of my first book :-) 
project management approach breaks a project down into three parts.

#### Build
The start of the *Lean* project is to first gather requirements from the core
constituencies and then developed an initial Minimum Viable Product (**MVP**).
The goal of the MVP is to only build the least amount of functionality and 
user interface design to meet but not exceed these requirements.
 
#### Measure
The next step in the loop is Measure, identifying key metrics and then releasing
the **MVP** for use by your patrons, customers, or other end users. Sometimes
after an initial release, minor adjustments can be made to the MVP based on the
measurements and feedback from the core user constituencies.

#### Learn
After completing the **Measure** phase, the Learn phase involves analyzing the
metrics that results in one of three decisions:

*   Continue the project and start preparing for the next BML iteration's Build
    phase.

*   Pivot the focus of project to a new area or service based on the actionable 
    metrics.

*   Terminate the project based on negative metrics or administrative decision.
