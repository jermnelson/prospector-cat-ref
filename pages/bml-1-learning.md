From the actionable metrics from the **Measure Phase**, we came to the 
following conclusions: 

*   Search results for more unique items starting showing up on the first page of Google 
    results, more common items were buried deep in the results pages.
*   ILS restriction on indexing Catalogs, both University of Colorado's and Colorado 
    College's robots.txt file restricted indexing of individual items, hence the 
    explanation of the missing pages in the Google search.
*   Publishing Landing Pages as HTML, as the Alliance cannot control what individual
    vendors permit in terms of search engine indexing, the initial BF Instance stub
    or placeholder view should be expanded to offer 
*   GIS information embedded in the Schema.org metadata doesn't seem to impact result 
    order in a Google search. 
*   SEO friendly URLs, using UUIDs for the BF Instance and Items should be modified 
    for easy for human consumption.
